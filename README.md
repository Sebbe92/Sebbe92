<h2>About me</h2>
I specialize in web development, with a command of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Nextjs, Bootstrap and Tailwind. While my primary focus is on these areas, I have a passion for game development. I have actively explored game development using Unity and C#, and have also dabbled in creating simple 2D games using JavaScript. In addition to my interest in game development, I enjoy experimenting with Arduino and engaging in projects involving weak electronics and artificial intelligence.
<h3>What Gpt-4 think of me</h3>
<p>Sebastian is an energetic guy residing in the beautiful city of Oslo, Norway. he's a gym enthusiast who loves to stay active and challenge his physical limits, finding a sense of accomplishment in every rep.

he's passionate about fishing. The calm of nature, the patience it requires, and the surprise element of the catch - it's a hobby that brings balance to my high-octane lifestyle.

He shares his life with a wonderful girlfriend and a lovable dog.

Despite his active lifestyle, he also knows how to unwind and enjoy some good old weekend fun. Whether it's a night out with friends or a quiet evening at home, he cherish these moments of leisure.

In essence, he's someone who enjoys the contrast of life - the rush and the calm, the strength and the tenderness, the discipline and the fun. He's continually seeking new experiences, growth, and a good laugh along the journey.</p>
